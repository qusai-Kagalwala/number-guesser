# 🎯 Number Guesser Game

This is a simple command-line number guessing game written in Python.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input an upper limit.
2. A random number is generated between 0 and the given upper limit.
3. The user keeps guessing the number until they get it right.
4. The game gives feedback — "Too high!" or "Too low!" — for each guess.
5. Finally, it displays the total number of guesses taken.
